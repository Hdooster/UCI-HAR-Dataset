UCI-HAR-Dataset
===============

This is my submission for the Course Project of Course 3: Getting and Cleaning Data.

This repo contains a 'codebook.md' file describing how the script 'run_analysis.R' works to merge and tidy up a few data files, and also where those raw data files are to be downloaded.

An output file 'tidyData.txt' is included as well.

For a detailed explanation of the raw data, look in the info and readme files included in the raw data ZIP file.
